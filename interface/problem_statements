Interfaces
Under the hood, interface values can be thought of as a tuple of a value and a concrete type:
(value, type)

1. problem_01
    A value of interface type can hold any value that implements the methods of interface type.
    Catch: receiver type should match. We cannot assign a type which implements pointer receiver type to a interface
    type which is expecting a value receiver type and vice versa

2. problem_02
   A interface type can only call methods declared in the interface on the concrete type it is holding
